## Abstract

The primary uncertainty in modern distributed systems stems from **inter-service interaction logic**: semantics are obscure, drift is frequent, and validation is delayed. **ChoreoAtlas** centers on a **dual contract system (`ServiceSpec` & `FlowSpec`)** and **dual-mode governance platform (explore & generate / specify & validate)** to move interaction logic forward to the design and pre-integration phases through "**contracts-as-code**" and "**specs-as-reviewable**" for modeling and validation, forming a closed loop of **design-implementation-observation-validation-generation**. The platform leverages standardized signals like OpenTelemetry for **trace alignment** without invading business code, providing auditable evidence chains for **implementability, self-consistency, and behavioral consistency**. The result is significantly reduced **integration costs** and **regression risks**, with improved engineering certainty.

**Executive Summary**: Make invisible interaction logic visible, replace fragile word-of-mouth and natural language documentation with compilable/validatable/replayable specifications, and guard the "changes don't break" red line with **CI Gates** and **runtime validation**.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Problems

Microservices/event-driven architectures make **functional decomposition easy** but make **interaction correctness difficult**. Interaction logic often exists in three invisible forms: natural language, tribal knowledge, and hard-coding. They lead to **absent specifications** and **logic drift**, delaying defect exposure until integration or even production.

### 1.2 Vision

Make interaction logic explicit, versioned, and automatically validated through **executable specifications**, establishing a **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** where "**implementability**" can be machine-verified before implementation, and "**consistency**" is enforced by pipelines during changes.

### 1.3 Terms and Keywords Convention

**MUST/SHOULD/MAY** in this document follow RFC 2119/8174 specifications (Appendix §12.4).

---

## 2. Core Principles and Requirements

### 2.1 Contracts-as-Code (Spec-as-Code)

* **Strong Binding**: `ServiceSpec` **co-located** with interface implementation (annotations/inline DSL), evolving with code versions.
* **High Fidelity**: Describes **observable behavioral promises** (pre/post conditions, events, side effects, idempotency/consistency levels).
* **Composable**: `FlowSpec` uses flowchart-style DSL to **reference** multiple `ServiceSpec`, describing **sequential/parallel/compensation** relationships.

### 2.2 Specifications-for-Review (Spec-for-Review)

* Specifications are **structured logic models** that MUST support **static checking** (reference closure, type/domain validation, dead branch detection) and **dynamic verification** (trace alignment, event completeness).
* Before changes enter the main branch, CI Gate MUST pass **specification validation**, failing means merge rejection.

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

* **Security**: Sandboxed expressions (CEL/CUE/JSONLogic), sensitive field masking, artifact signing (Sigstore).
* **Performance**: Runtime validation overhead **≤1%** p99 latency (target); supports gradual rollout and sampling.
* **Observability**: Evidence, inputs/outputs, rule versions, hashes, and timestamps for each validation are auditable.
* **Portability**: Specification semantics decoupled from language/framework; adapts to REST/RPC/messaging/stream processing.
* **Usability**: VS Code/JetBrains extensions, hint templates, reverse-engineering drafts from traces.

**Executive Summary**: Specifications are not documentation, they're **executable artifacts**; not bystanders, but **pipeline gates**.

## 3. System Architecture and Design

### 3.1 Governance Loop (Macro View)

        A[Service A] -- OTel --> COL(Collector)
        B[Service B] -- OTel --> COL
        MQ[Message Bus/Event Stream] --> COL

    end
```

> The platform only manages **specifications and validation**, **does not take over** business releases; embeds in CI as **plugins**, or provides status checks as **GitHub App**.

### 3.2 Semantic Layers and Boundaries

| Dimension | ServiceSpec | FlowSpec |
| -- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Granularity | Single interface/Topic behavioral contract | End-to-end business flow |
| Binding | Code annotation/inline | Independent YAML/DSL |
| Focus | Pre/post conditions, events, idempotency, consistency levels, implicit SLO | Sequential/parallel, branching, compensation, timeout, retry strategies |
| Validation | Static & dynamic (single point) | Dynamic trace and data mapping (cross-point) |
| Async | Event names, idempotency keys, delivery semantics, deduplication | Out-of-order/at-least-once/compensation/timeout handling |

### 3.3 `ServiceSpec` (Behavioral Contract)

**Example (Java annotation/pseudo-syntax)**:

```java
/**
 * @ServiceSpec
 * op: "createOrder"
 * pre:  user.status == 'ACTIVE' && cart.items.size() > 0
 * guarantees:
 *   - db.orders.exists(orderId) && order.status == 'PENDING'
 *   - event.emitted('OrderCreated', {orderId, userId})
 * idempotency:
 *   key: request.idempotencyKey
 *   effect: "REPLAY_SAME_RESULT"
 * consistency: "EVENTUAL(≤5m)" // Allow downstream inventory eventual consistency
 * timeout: "800ms" retries: {max:2, backoff:"exp"}
 */
Order createOrder(CreateOrderRequest req) { ... }
```

**Key Points**

* **Idempotency semantics** (required): Key, observable behavior for duplicate requests.
* **Consistency level**: Strong consistency/read committed/eventual consistency (with time bounds); used for FlowSpec reasoning.
* **Observable evidence**: DB state, events, external calls, verifiable through OTel/custom instrumentation sampling.
* **Side effect declaration**: External system writes/calls, used for change impact analysis.

### 3.4 `FlowSpec` (Orchestration Contract)

**Example (`.flowspec.yaml` with compensation and timeout)**:

```yaml
info:
  title: "Order-Inventory-Shipping"
  sla: { p99_latency: "≤1500ms", success_rate: "≥99.5%" }

services:
  order: { spec: "./order/service.spec.yaml" }
  stock: { spec: "./stock/service.spec.yaml" }
  ship:  { spec: "./shipping/service.spec.yaml" }

flow:
  - step: "Create Order"
    call: order.createOrder
    out: { orderId: "$.response.orderId", userId: "$.request.userId" }

  - step: "Reserve Inventory"
    call: stock.reserve
    in:  { orderId: "$.orderId" }
    retry: { max: 3, backoff: "exp" }
    compensate:
      call: order.cancel
      when: "$.error.category in ['NO_STOCK','TIMEOUT']"

  - step: "Arrange Shipping"
    call: ship.createShipment
    in: { orderId: "$.orderId" }
    timeout: "1000ms"
    onTimeout:
      emit: "ShipmentPending"
```

**Key Points**

* **Control structures**: Sequential/parallel/conditional/timeout/retry/compensation (Saga).
* **Data mapping**: JSONPath/expression mapping, type and required field validation.
* **SLA projection**: End-to-end SLO derived from ServiceSpec composition **target bandwidth/latency budget**.
* **Async robustness**: Remediation strategies for out-of-order/duplicate/lost events explicitly defined in FlowSpec.

### 3.5 Trace Alignment (Trace-Spec Matching) Algorithm Overview

* **Input**: OTel Trace (cross-service/cross-message channels), FlowSpec steps and expected events.
* **Alignment**: Treat trace as event sequence, perform **weighted dynamic programming matching** by time window, correlation keys (orderId, traceId, idempotency key) (allowing jumps/late arrivals).
* **Output**: Match confidence, missing/extra steps, attribute differences; produces auditable reports (hash+signature).
* **Complexity**: O(n·m) (n = trace length, m = FlowSpec steps), heuristic pruning controls upper bound.

| Policy Integration | OPA/Gatekeeper | Kyverno | Unified with cluster/pipeline policies |

**Executive Summary**: Specifications are **signable artifacts**; pipelines and runtime have **unified evidence and policy paths**.

---

## 5. Competitive Landscape and Differentiation (Methodology Perspective)

| Category/Representative | Capability Focus | Typical Limitations | ChoreoAtlas Position |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Contract Testing (Pact, etc.) | Producer/consumer interface contracts | Point-to-point, lacks flow and async semantics | **Introduce cross-service flow and compensation semantics** |
| API Orchestration (Postman Flow, etc.) | Design and visualization | Weak validation, isolated from real runtime | **Bidirectional mapping with real traces** |
| Trace-driven Testing (Tracetest, etc.) | Observation-based validation | Manual YAML, lacks model abstraction | **Explore-generate, model-first** |

**Key Differentiators**: **Dual contracts + dual modes**, **end-to-end async semantics**, **auditable evidence**, **native integration of Spec-as-Code with CI Gate**.

---

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverables | Timeline |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| Phase 0 | Internal PoC | VSCode plugin, CLI validator, minimal FlowSpec | 2026 Q1 |
| Phase 1 | MVP Open Source | ServiceSpec DSL, trace alignment kernel, report portal | 2026 Q2 |
| Phase 2 | Enterprise Capabilities | SSO/LDAP, RBAC, audit, SLA specifications | 2026 Q3 |
| Phase 3 | Ecosystem Extension | JetBrains plugin, GitHub App, OPA integration | 2026 Q4 |

**Milestone Criteria** (MUST): Each phase passes **acceptance checklist** (Appendix §12.7).

---

## 7. Early PoC Solution (Executable Blueprint)

### 7.1 Scenario and Technology Stack

E-commerce "Order-Inventory-Shipping" three services (Java + Spring Boot + Kafka/HTTP, OTel auto/manual instrumentation).

### 7.2 Steps

1. Enable OTel + correlation key injection (orderId, idempotency key) for 3 services.
2. Write `ServiceSpec` (≥10 interfaces), covering idempotency and consistency.
3. Write `FlowSpec` (2 main flows + 1 exception/compensation flow).
4. Use RestAssured/Karate to trigger end-to-end; run validator to generate reports.
5. Integrate CI Gate: introduce 3 types of defects (timeout, out-of-order, duplicate messages) to verify fail-fast.

### 7.3 Success/Failure Metrics (Quantifiable)

* **Trace-Spec match rate** ≥ 90% (target); **false positive rate** ≤ 3%.
* **Spec writing per-person time** ≤ 2h; **explore-generate coverage** ≥ 70%.
* When introducing deliberate bugs, **CI MUST fail** (block merge).
* **Additional overhead** on p99 latency ≤ 1%.

**Executive Summary**: PoC success means "**can validate interaction correctness without changing code**", achieving "provable stability" at controllable cost.

---

## 8. Application Scenarios and Value

* **Onboarding**: Reading specifications equals reading system maps, reducing dependence on oral tradition.
* **Large-scale refactoring/migration**: Specifications guard external behavior invariance; change impact is visualized.
* **Test efficiency**: Static + dynamic dual tracks, reducing manual cost of "fabricating integration test cases".
* **AI-assisted development**: RAG uses specification repository as knowledge source, generating code/fix suggestions and explanations.
* **SaaS multi-tenancy**: ServiceSpec differentiation generates tenant-level regression suites, reducing regression costs.

**Value Anchor**: Reduce **rework/rollback** and **cross-team communication costs**, improve **change throughput**.

---

## 9. Business Model and ROI Calculation

### 9.1 Models

| Model | Revenue | Estimated ARPU | Notes |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| OSS + Cloud | Validation compute/SaaS | $5–10 / service / month | Tiered by trace/call volume |
| Enterprise | Private license & support | $50k–200k / year | Security/compliance/offline capabilities |
| Marketplace | Plugin revenue share | 30% | Third-party adapters and rule sets |

### 9.2 Simple ROI Model

* **Saved labor costs**:
  $$\text{ROI} = \frac{(\Delta T_{\text{integration}}+\Delta T_{\text{regression}}+\Delta T_{\text{defect fix}})\times C_{\text{person-hour}} - C_{\text{platform}}}{C_{\text{platform}}}$$

* **Parameter guidance**:
  * $\Delta T_{\text{integration}}$: Integration time (weeks) saved by early validation.
  * $\Delta T_{\text{defect fix}}$: Defect discovery moved from production/integration to design/development **relative factor 5–30x**.
  * $C_{\text{platform}}$: Subscription + compute + ops.

**Executive Summary**: Moving "discovery moment" forward one stage results in order-of-magnitude reduction in defect costs.

---

## 10. Future Outlook

* **Performance specifications**: Include p99/p999, throughput, and error budgets in specifications with automatic verification.
* **Self-healing suggestions**: When validation fails, AI provides fix patches or configuration change suggestions.
* **Natural language to specifications**: Generate `FlowSpec/ServiceSpec` drafts from user stories/tickets and run validation.
* **Policy unification**: Integrate with OPA/Kyverno, SLO platforms to form unified change policies.

---

## 11. Conclusion

**ChoreoAtlas** uses **executable specifications** and **dual-mode platform** to move interaction logic governance forward to design time and pre-integration, forming an **evidence-driven** engineering loop. It is both methodology (Spec-as-Code & Spec-for-Review) and engineering product (specifications, toolchain, and reports), aimed at continuously reducing **uncertainty in cross-service interactions** without changing team technology stacks.

### 12.5 Trace Alignment Algorithm (Pseudo-code)

```
match(flow, trace):
  events = normalize(trace)        // Normalize span/event/logs
  steps  = flatten(flow)           // Expand sequential/parallel/branches
  dp = matrix(len(steps)+1, len(events)+1, -INF)
  dp[0][0] = 0
  for i in 0..len(steps):
    for j in 0..len(events):
      // Skip event (late/noise)
      dp[i][j+1] = max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i][j] - penalty_skip_event)
      // Missing step (omission)
      dp[i+1][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j] - penalty_missing_step)
      // Alignment match
      if compatible(steps[i], events[j]):
         w = score(steps[i], events[j])  // Name/attributes/time window/correlation key
         dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j+1], dp[i][j] + w)
  return reconstruct(dp), confidence(dp[end][end])
```

### 12.6 Compatibility and Versioning

* **Spec semantic versioning**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`;
  * **Breaking** (MAJOR++): Remove fields/change idempotency effect/consistency level upgrade failure paths.
  * **Backward compatible** (MINOR++): Add optional fields/new events.
  * **Fix** (PATCH++): Description fixes, spelling, no semantic changes.
* **Compatibility matrix**: Compatibility between `ServiceSpec(vX)` and `FlowSpec(vY)` is enforced during validation.

### 12.7 Threat Model and Compliance

* **Spec injection**: Malicious spec changes bypass validation → artifact signing, two-person review, protected branches.
* **Privacy and compliance**: Trace field masking (PII/PCI), field-level whitelist; data residency policy.
* **Supply chain**: SBOM and provenance for specs and binaries, verify signatures and sources in CI.

### 12.8 PoC Acceptance Checklist (Excerpt)

* [ ] OTel sampling rate ≥ 10%, critical path 100% sampling.
* [ ] `ServiceSpec` completeness ≥ 80%, must include idempotency, consistency, timeout/retry.
* [ ] FlowSpec covers main/exception/compensation paths.
* [ ] Three defect injections: duplicate messages, timeout, insufficient inventory → CI Gate blocks.
* [ ] Runtime overhead measurement (before/after p99 comparison).
